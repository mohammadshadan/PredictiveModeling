The practice of predictive modeling defines the process of
developing a model in a way that we can understand and quantify the model's
prediction accuracy on future, yet-to-be-seen data.

```{r}
# install.packages("AppliedPredictiveModeling")
library(AppliedPredictiveModeling)
data(segmentationOriginal)
head(segmentationOriginal)

dim(segmentationOriginal)
str(segmentationOriginal)
names(segmentationOriginal)

?readLines
